CapsCheck-Plugin
================

Plugin for bukkit

This is my first Bukkit plugin.  It is meant to:
1. Recieve the input of a player
2. Check if it uses caps excessively
3. Filter the caps and set it all to lowercase
4. Kick the player if they are warned X times
5. Mute the player if they are kicked X times
