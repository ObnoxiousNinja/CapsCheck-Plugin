CapsCheck-Plugin
================

Plugin for bukkit

This is my first Bukkit plugin.  It is meant to:
1. Recieve the input of a player\n
2. Check if it uses caps excessively\n
3. Filter the caps and set it all to lowercase\n
4. Kick the player if they are warned X times
5. Mute the player if they are kicked X times
