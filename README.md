CapsCheck-Plugin
================

Plugin for bukkit

This is my first Bukkit plugin.  It is meant to:
* Recieve the input of a player
* Check if it uses caps excessively
* Filter the caps and set it all to lowercase
* Kick the player if they are warned X times
* Mute the player if they are kicked X times
